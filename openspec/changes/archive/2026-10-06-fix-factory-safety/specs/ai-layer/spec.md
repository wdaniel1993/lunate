## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Chat-client factory pipeline order
`IChatClientFactory.Create` SHALL build the pipeline in the fixed order, outermost first: OpenTelemetry (opt-in) → logging → accumulator → recorder slot → provider. Replay will replace recorder + provider so tests still pass through the telemetry and logging layers.

#### Scenario: Pipeline order is fixed
- **GIVEN** a factory configured with a stub provider client
- **WHEN** a pipeline is created and a request flows through it
- **THEN** the telemetry, logging, accumulator, recorder and provider layers observe the request in exactly that order

#### Scenario: FunctionInvokingChatClient is never used
- **GIVEN** any factory configuration
- **WHEN** the pipeline is built
- **THEN** no `FunctionInvokingChatClient` or `AIFunctionFactory` appears anywhere in it

### Requirement: Recording and replay of provider streams
`Lunate.Ai` SHALL record provider exchanges as JSONL when `LUNATE_RECORD=1` for both call styles: a streamed exchange (`GetStreamingResponseAsync`) records its update sequence, and an aggregated exchange (`GetResponseAsync`) records the response as its update sequence so replay serves both call styles from one exchange. `Lunate.Ai` SHALL replay fixtures deterministically: `ReplayChatClient` answers requests from the recorded exchanges in order, verifying each request digest, with actionable errors on mismatch or exhaustion. Fixtures SHALL serialize Microsoft.Extensions.AI types with `AIJsonUtilities` options and replay SHALL NOT require API keys or network access. When `LUNATE_RECORD=1` is set without an explicit path, recordings SHALL default under the user's home directory (`~/.lunate/recordings/`), never inside the current working directory.

#### Scenario: Record then replay is identical
- **GIVEN** a provider stream recorded to a fixture
- **WHEN** `ReplayChatClient` serves the same request
- **THEN** the replayed updates are identical to the recorded ones

#### Scenario: Aggregated exchange record then replay is identical
- **GIVEN** a provider response recorded via `GetResponseAsync`
- **WHEN** `ReplayChatClient` serves the same request
- **THEN** the replayed aggregated response matches the recorded response

#### Scenario: Request mismatch fails actionably
- **GIVEN** a fixture whose next exchange has digest A
- **WHEN** a request with digest B arrives
- **THEN** replay fails with an error naming the fixture, the exchange index and the digests

#### Scenario: Replay needs no API keys or network
- **GIVEN** any committed fixture
- **WHEN** it is replayed
- **THEN** no network call and no API key is required

#### Scenario: Factory wires the recorder
- **GIVEN** `LUNATE_RECORD=1` with a recording path
- **WHEN** the factory builds a pipeline
- **THEN** a recorder writes each exchange to the path while the stream passes through unchanged

#### Scenario: Default recordings are user-scoped
- **GIVEN** `LUNATE_RECORD=1` without `LUNATE_RECORD_PATH`
- **WHEN** the factory wires the recorder
- **THEN** the recording path is under `~/.lunate/recordings/`, not inside the current working directory

### Requirement: Local endpoints without a dummy key
The factory SHALL send a provider's environment API key only to the provider's default endpoint: when a model declares a custom endpoint, both the OpenAI-compatible and the Anthropic adapter SHALL construct their clients with a placeholder credential instead of the environment key, and SHALL NOT fail for a missing key — so local servers work without dummy environment variables and real keys are never sent to third-party endpoints. A model that spells out the provider's own default URL counts as a custom endpoint. Explicit per-model key references arrive with the settings work (T-16).

#### Scenario: Custom endpoint without a key
- **GIVEN** a model with a custom endpoint and no `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **WHEN** the factory builds the pipeline
- **THEN** no error is raised and requests target the custom endpoint

#### Scenario: Custom endpoint never receives the environment key
- **GIVEN** a model with a custom endpoint and `OPENAI_API_KEY` set
- **WHEN** the factory builds the pipeline
- **THEN** the client uses the placeholder credential, not the environment key

#### Scenario: The Anthropic adapter is symmetric
- **GIVEN** an Anthropic model with a custom endpoint and no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **WHEN** the factory builds the pipeline
- **THEN** no error is raised and the client uses the placeholder credential

#### Scenario: Default endpoint requires the environment key
- **GIVEN** a model without a custom endpoint and no key in the environment
- **WHEN** the factory builds the pipeline
- **THEN** it fails with an actionable error naming the variable and T-16
